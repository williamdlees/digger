Digger: tools for annotating genomic assemblies of the IG/TR receptor loci
============================================================================
Digger is a toolkit for the automatic annotation of unrearranged V,D and J genes in B- and T- cell immunoglobulin receptor genomic loci. It can be used to annotate both entire assemblies or large fragments of a locus, 
or small fragments. It is designed for use with entire gene sequences, including leader and RSS (V-gene UTRs are not required, and are currently not annotated).
