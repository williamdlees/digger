Additional Examples
===================

Additional examples, covering the IG loci of human and rhesus macaque, can be found in the `tests folder <https://github.com/williamdlees/digger/tree/main/tests>`__ of the digger Github repo. 
In each case, the example consists of a script file, ``run_digger.bat``, which will download necessary data and conduct the analysis, and the analysis results.
Despite its extension, ``run_digger.bat`` will run under a Linux shell (``source run_digger.bat``), or under Windows. For Windows, the 
`Gnu core utilities <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`__, or some other implementation of simple Linux shell commands, are required.
