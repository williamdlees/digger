Functional sequences reported by digger but not by Watson et al.:
74289,74590  imgt_match:   imgt_func:  digger_match: IGKV2-4*01  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed, BLAST alignment was truncated
...Annotated by IMGT as P, having a corrupted leader, but the leader identified by digger appears to be feasible
121106,121395  imgt_match: IGKV3-7*04  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV3-7*04  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed
...Marked as ORF in Watson et al. and currently classified by IMGT as ORF on the basis of an incomplete sequence
271344,271645  imgt_match:   imgt_func:  digger_match: IGKV2-18*01  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed
...Not found by Watson et al
302389,302675  imgt_match: IGKV6-21*01  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV6-21*01  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed
...Marked as ORF in Watson et al. but currently classified by IMGT as functional

Functional sequences reported by Watson et al. but not by digger:
472754,473043  imgt_match: IGKV2-40*01  imgt_func: functional digger_match: IGKV2-40*01  digger_func: orf  notes: Gene reversed, Stop codon in leader, Leader missing initial ATG, BLAST alignment was truncated
...sequence has NNNN in L-PART1. Would have been annotated as F if the sequence had been complete.
