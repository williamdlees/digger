1164541,1164827  imgt_match: IGKV6D-21*02  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV6D-21*02  digger_func: functional  notes: 
...Marked as ORF in Watson et al. but currently classified by IMGT as functional
1195699,1196000  imgt_match:   imgt_func:  digger_match: IGKV2D-18*01  digger_func: functional  notes: 
...Annotated by IMGT as P, having no ATG in leader, but the leader identified by digger appears to be feasible

...imgt: Non canonical V-HEPTAMER: CACTGTG instead of CACAGTG: digger uses a more lenient filter 
1264891,1265192  imgt_match:   imgt_func:  digger_match: IGKV2D-29*01  digger_func: functional  notes: 
..imgt: 2-29*01 annotated as P because of STOP-CODON at position 88 in FR3-IMGT but our sequence looks ok
1333035,1333321  imgt_match: IGKV1D-42*02  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV1D-42*02  digger_func: functional  notes: 
...imgt: TTTGCTT instead of TTTGCAT in the core sequence of the DECAMER, and altered V-HEPTAMER: CACAGGG instead of CACAGTG
