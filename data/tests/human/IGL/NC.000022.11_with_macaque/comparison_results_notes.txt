686835,687124  imgt_match: IGLV3-21*02  imgt_func: functional digger_match: IGLV3-21*02  digger_func: orf  notes: Stop codon in leader, Leader missing initial ATG
..I can't see a sequence in the upstream region that matches the leader sequence IMGT have annotated for this gene.
..This sequence occurs immediately upstram of the V-gene. Suspect an assembly error:
