...imgt: noncanonical V-HEPTAMER: tcctgtg instead of cacagtg
because of changes in the training sequence, tcctgtg no longer passes digger's threshold for a heptamer
however as this sequence is found rearranged, we should probably add tcctgtg to the list of valid heptamers and adjust the pwms accordingly.

...correct starting position not found: 100657 instead of 100678
...the correct l_part1 ttgcagaaagc narrowly fails the likelihood threshold mainly as a result of the starting T as opposed to consensus G
