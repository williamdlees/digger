The comparison here is with Supplementary Table 1 from Watson et al., 2015, "Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library 
reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity." Genes Immun., doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.56. 
 
Watson et al. derived the gene functionality from IMGT's database, hence the notes here refer both to Watson et al.'s annotation and IMGT's classification

1164541,1164827  imgt_match: IGKV6D-21*02  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV6D-21*02  digger_func: functional  notes: 
...Marked as ORF in Watson et al. but currently classified by IMGT as functional
1212594,1212880  imgt_match: IGKV6D-41*01  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV6D-41*01  digger_func: functional  notes:
...imgt: Non canonical V-HEPTAMER: CACTGTG instead of CACAGTG: digger uses a more lenient filter 
1264891,1265192  imgt_match:   imgt_func:  digger_match: IGKV2D-29*01  digger_func: functional  notes: 
..currently imgt classify 2-29*01 as P because of a STOP-CODON at position 88 in FR3-IMGT
..IMGT's classification was based on a different assembly. In this assembly there is no stop codon.
1333035,1333321  imgt_match: IGKV1D-42*02  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV1D-42*02  digger_func: functional  notes: 
...imgt: TTTGCTT instead of TTTGCAT in the core sequence of the DECAMER, and altered V-HEPTAMER: CACAGGG instead of CACAGTG
...digger currently uses a more lenient filter for the V-HEPTAMER, and does not check the L-PART1 DECAMER motif.
