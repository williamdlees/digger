The comparison here is with Supplementary Table 1 from Watson et al., 2015, "Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library 
reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity." Genes Immun., doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.56. 
 
Watson et al. derived the gene functionality from IMGT's database, hence the notes here refer both to Watson et al.'s annotation and IMGT's classification
