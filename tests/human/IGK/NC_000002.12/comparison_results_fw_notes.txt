The comparison here is with Supplementary Table 1 from Watson et al., 2015, "Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library 
reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity." Genes Immun., doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.56. 
 
Watson et al. derived the gene functionality from IMGT's database, hence the notes here refer both to Watson et al.'s annotation and IMGT's classification


type: V
Functional sequences reported by digger but not by Watson et al.:
121106,121395  imgt_match:  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV3-7*04  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed
...IMGT notes on curated sequence: In the absence of complete sequence the functionality ORF has been assigned based on the other alleles.
...IMGT's classification was based on a different assembly. In this assembly we have the complete sequence.
220659,220960  imgt_match:   imgt_func:  digger_match: IGKV2D-29*01  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed
..imgt: 2-29*01 annotated as P because of STOP-CODON at position 88 in FR3-IMGT.
..IMGT's classification was based on a different assembly. In this assembly there is no stop codon.
302389,302675  imgt_match: IGKV6-21*01  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGKV6-21*01  digger_func: functional  notes: Gene reversed
...Marked as ORF in Watson et al. but currently classified in the IMGT system IMGT as functional

Functional sequences reported by Watson et al. but not by digger:
472754,473043  imgt_match: IGKV2-40*01  imgt_func: functional digger_match: IGKV2-40*01  digger_func: orf  notes: Gene reversed, Stop codon in leader, Leader missing initial ATG, BLAST alignment was truncated
...sequence has NNNN in L-PART1.
