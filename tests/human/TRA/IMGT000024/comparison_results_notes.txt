520842,521125  imgt_match: TRAV8-7*02  imgt_func: pseudo digger_match: TRAV8-7*02  digger_func: functional  notes: 
..IMGT reports pseudogene due to the insertion of a 6-nucleotide insertion ggagga in the V-HEPTAMER motif (D. Scaviner, M-P. Lefranc, 11/01/2002).
.. This insertion is not seen in this assembly sequence (the observation pre-dates the assembly)

..the V-NONAMER CCGTTTTCC does not pass digger's likelihood threshold

...IMGT reports these sequences as having stop codons in the J-REGION. Digger allows stop codons before the W/FGXG motif as these may be trimmed during junction formation
