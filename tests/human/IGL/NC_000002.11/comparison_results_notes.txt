The comparison here is with Supplementary Table 2 from Watson et al., 2015, "Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library 
reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity." Genes Immun., doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.56. 
 
Watson et al. derived the gene functionality from IMGT's database, hence the notes here refer both to Watson et al.'s annotation and IMGT's classification

...no allele was found at this location in the annotation by Watson et al. 
...IGLV5-37*02 is in the IMGT reference set, but is not listed in the IMGT gene table. IGLV5-37*01 is listed as functional

..imgt: Non-conserved OCTAMER sequence: ctgcacaa instead of atttgcat, non-conserved TATA_BOX, and unusual V-NONAMER sequence: agaagaacc instead of acaaaaacc 
...digger currently uses a more lenient filter for the V-NONAMER, and does not check the L-PART1 OCTAMER motif.
