The comparison here is with Supplementary Table 1 from Watson et al., 2015, "Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library 
reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity." Genes Immun., doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.56. 
 
Watson et al. derived the gene functionality from IMGT's database, hence the notes here refer both to Watson et al.'s annotation and IMGT's classification


type: V
Functional sequences reported by digger but not by Watson et al.:
301443,301741  imgt_match: IGLV1-50*01  imgt_func: ORF digger_match: IGLV1-50*01  digger_func: functional  notes:
..imgt: Non-conserved OCTAMER sequence: ctgcacaa instead of atttgcat, non-conserved TATA_BOX, and unusual V-NONAMER sequence: agaagaacc instead of acaaaaacc 
...digger currently uses a more lenient filter for the V-NONAMER, and does not check the L-PART1 OCTAMER motif.
