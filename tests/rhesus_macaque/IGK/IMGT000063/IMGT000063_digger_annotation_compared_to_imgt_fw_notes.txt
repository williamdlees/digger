269349,269650  imgt_match: IGKV2-83*01  imgt_func: pseudo digger_match: IGKV2-83*01  digger_func: functional  notes: 
...imgt notes: STOP-CODON in V-REGION: position 110. 
...Digger allows stop codons after position 104 as they may be excised during junction formation

...imgt notes: noncanonical V-HEPTAMER: cacgctg instead of cacagtg
...digger has a less stringent consensus check

...imgt notes: no INIT-CODON: Ile instead of Met, frameshift in L-PART1
...digger identified a functional L-PART1 that met the PWM likelihood threshold
